        Cardiac Surgery - Paediatric
        Cardiac Surgery at Narayana Health specializes in all streams of cardiac surgery and is world-renowned for dealing with complex heart problems.

        Cardiac surgery in children is recommended to repair heart defects and for the child’s wellbeing in the long-term. Certain heart defects may demand immediate surgery after birth. In some cases, surgeries are performed months or even years after birth. The type and number of surgeries needed vary on the severity of the condition. Pediatric heart surgeons are trained to offer exclusive and comprehensive care to treat children and mend the defected heart.

        Minimally invasive treatment procedures are considered for the patients initially. If they do not work out, the health care team is ready to proceed with more invasive methods to prevent infection and reduce risks. This period of time is very crucial for parents. Narayana’s team realizes the situation of the parents and communicates with them regularly to update the status of their child.

        </h2>
        <h2>What is a Kidney Transplant?</h2>
      <p>
        A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure that’s done to treat kidney failure. The kidneys filter waste from the blood and remove it from the body through your urine. They also help maintain your body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. If your kidneys stop working, waste builds up in your body and can make you very sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        People whose kidneys have failed usually undergo a treatment called dialysis. This treatment mechanically filters waste that builds up in the bloodstream when the kidneys stop working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people whose kidneys have failed may qualify for a kidney transplant. In this procedure, one or both kidneys are replaced with donor kidneys from a live or deceased person.
      </p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons of Dialysis and Kidney Transplants:</h3>
      <p>
        Undergoing dialysis takes time and is labor-intensive. Dialysis often requires making frequent trips to a dialysis center to receive treatment. At the dialysis center, your blood is cleansed using a dialysis machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a candidate to have dialysis at home, you’ll need to purchase dialysis supplies and learn how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A kidney transplant can free you from a long-term dependence on a dialysis machine and the strict schedule that goes with it. This can allow you to live a more active life. However, kidney transplants aren’t suitable for everyone. This includes people with active infections and those who are severely overweight.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a kidney transplant, your surgeon will take a donated kidney and place it in your body. Even though you’re born with two kidneys, you can lead a healthy life with only one functioning kidney. After the transplant, you’ll have to take immune-suppressing medications to keep your immune system from attacking the new organ.

          <i className="fas fa-flask">How Can Orthopedic Physical Therapy Help You?</i>
        </h2>
       Orthopedic physical therapy can be life-changing. A skilled physical therapist (PT) can get you back on track with your daily activities after surgery, an injury, accident, or illness. That’s because an orthopedic PT specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions that affect any part of your musculoskeletal system. An orthopedic PT works to integrate all your other bodily systems — especially your neurological and cardiovascular systems — with your musculoskeletal system to treat your injury or condition appropriately. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what orthopedic physical therapy is, when you may need it, and the types of treatments it includes. What’s orthopedic physical therapy? Orthopedic physical therapy involves the care of your entire musculoskeletal system, which includes your: bones muscles ligaments and tendons joints connective tissue A PT who specializes in orthopedics can evaluate your condition and diagnose the issue or condition you have. This will include: determining the appropriate movement diagnosis creating a treatment plan administering therapeutic care educating you about how to manage your current injury or condition to prevent further injury Orthopedic physical therapy is provided in outpatient clinics, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, sports facilities, and even in your home. The entry-level degree for a PT these days is a clinical doctorate. So when you go to work with a PT, you’re working with a doctor of physical therapy, who has completed three years of graduate school studies. What conditions does an orthopedic physical therapist treat? “Orthopedic physical therapists treat almost any condition that affects your ability to move or function physically in your daily life,” said Steve Vighetti, a fellow of the American Academy of Manual Orthopedic Physical Therapists. Let’s look at some of the most common conditions and issues that are treated by orthopedic PTs. Conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system Orthopedic physical therapy can be a primary or complementary treatment option for the following types of musculoskeletal conditions: arthritis bursitis cancer frozen shoulder knee instability joint pain limited range of motion lower back pain Lyme disease lymphedema muscular dystrophy Parkinson’s disease plantar fasciitis scoliosis spinal stenosis stroke Some PTs specialize in treating specific patient populations. A sports PT, for example, can help athletes move safely in an effort to prevent injuries. They can also help athletes recover from sports-related injuries. A PT who works primarily with older adults can help their patients improve their balance to prevent falls. They can also help older adults recover from knee or hip replacement surgery, or maintain their strength and mobility as they age. Other PTs specialize in helping people recover from conditions like cancer or low back pain, or the effects of pregnancy and childbirth. “One condition people may not associate with physical therapy is pelvic floor dysfunction,” Vighetti said. “People accept urinary incontinence and painful sex almost as rights of passage after you’ve had a couple of children. It’s something people may not even realize you can get help for — but you can. You can make changes and see real improvements.” Rehabilitation after surgery After you have surgery, orthopedic physical therapy may help reduce pain, normalize your walking, improve your range of motion, and prevent excessive scar tissue buildup. Additionally, it may also help you regain your balance, strength, and mobility. Patients often work with orthopedic PTs after surgeries such as: hip replacement knee replacement knee arthroscopy rotator cuff repair heart surgery cancer surgery Rehabilitation after acute injury An acute injury is one that happens as a result of a single trauma to the body. If you sprain an ankle, tear your meniscus, or herniate a disc in your back, an orthopedic PT can help you: manage pain and swelling function with the weight-bearing restrictions your doctor recommends regain as much of your range of motion as possible rebuild your strength learn how to move in ways that don’t make your condition flare up again Rehabilitation after chronic injury A chronic injury is damage to your body that occurs over time, usually because your movement patterns have caused small, repetitive injuries to your tendons, bones, or joints. Examples of chronic injuries include: shin splints carpal tunnel syndrome tennis elbow An orthopedic PT can analyze your movement patterns to isolate the source of the injury. They can also help you manage symptoms like pain and swelling, and can educate you about how to move safely to avoid injuries in the future. What types of treatments are used? Orthopedic PTs use a wide range of therapeutic modalities, exercises, assistive devices, and patient education methods to help you. Depending on how your therapist uses these treatments, they may be: passive modalities (the therapist gives you a treatment), or active modalities (you perform or participate in a movement) Here are some examples of treatments that may be used with orthopedic physical therapy. Hot/cold therapy Orthopedic PTs use both cryotherapy (cold therapy) and thermotherapy (heat therapy) to treat musculoskeletal pain and swelling. In a 2015 studyTrusted Source involving 100 patients, both heat and ice helped prevent muscle damage, but cold used immediately after intense exercise was more effective at preventing muscle soreness.
